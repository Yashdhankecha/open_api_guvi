# 🍯 Agentic Honeypot — Scam Detection & Intelligence Extraction API

An AI-powered honeypot system that engages scammers in realistic, multi-turn conversations while silently extracting actionable intelligence — phone numbers, bank accounts, UPI IDs, phishing links, emails, case IDs, policy numbers, and more. The system automatically classifies scam types, assigns confidence scores, and reports structured findings via a callback webhook.

> **Built with:** FastAPI · LangChain · Pydantic v2 · asyncio · Regex + LLM dual-extraction

```

### How It Works

1. **Incoming message** hits the `/analyze` endpoint with the scammer's text and conversation history.
2. **Regex extraction** runs synchronously first — fast pattern matching for phones, accounts, UPIs, links, emails, case IDs, and suspicious keywords.
3. **Two parallel LLM agents** fire concurrently via `asyncio.gather`:
   - **Reply Agent** — Generates an in-character conversational response as "Ramesh Kumar," a naive 58-year-old retired government employee.
   - **Intel Agent** — Extracts structured intelligence (scam type, confidence level, phone numbers, bank accounts, UPI IDs, phishing links, emails, case IDs, policy numbers, order numbers, and analyst notes) using structured LLM output.
4. **Union & Merge** — Regex results and LLM results are deduplicated and merged for maximum coverage.
5. **Smart Pacing** — Configurable turn-based delays ensure realistic engagement timing.
6. **Callback** — After a configurable turn threshold, the final intelligence payload is POSTed to the callback webhook.

### Dual Extraction Strategy

The system uses **two independent extraction layers** to maximize intel coverage:

| Layer | Method | Strengths |
|---|---|---|
| **Regex Extractor** | Pattern matching (`extractor.py`) | Fast, deterministic, catches structured formats (phone patterns, URLs, email TLDs, case IDs) |
| **LLM Intel Agent** | Structured output (`agent.py`) | Understands context, catches spoken numbers ("nine eight seven..."), classifies scam type, assigns confidence |

Both layers are merged with deduplication — if regex and LLM both find the same phone number, it appears only once.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### `POST /analyze`
Main honeypot endpoint. Receives a scammer message, returns an in-character conversational reply.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "message": {
    "sender": "scammer",
    "text": "Your bank account is blocked! Send OTP immediately."
  },
  "conversationHistory": [
    {"sender": "scammer", "text": "Hello, this is SBI customer care."},
    {"sender": "user", "text": "Oh no, what happened to my account?"}
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "channel": "SMS",
    "language": "English",
    "locale": "IN"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "reply": "Sir, I am very worried! Which OTP are you talking about? I have received many messages today. Can you please tell me your direct number so I can call you back?"
}
```

**cURL Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "abc-123",
    "message": {"sender": "scammer", "text": "Your bank account is blocked!"}
  }'
```

### `GET /health`
Health check endpoint. Returns `{"status": "ok", "version": "1.0.0"}`.

### `GET /session/{session_id}`
Debug endpoint — view session state, extracted intel, turn count, and the full final payload.

### `GET /test-score/{session_id}`
Returns evaluation score breakdown for a session (detection, intel, engagement, structure — out of 100).

### `POST /session/{session_id}/callback`
Manually trigger the callback for a session (admin use).

## 📊 Callback Payload Format

The final payload sent to the configured callback endpoint:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "scamDetected": true,
  "scamType": "bank_fraud",
  "extractedIntelligence": {
    "phoneNumbers": ["+91-9876543210"],

}
```

### Field Descriptions

| `scamType` | `string` | Classified scam type (e.g., `bank_fraud`, `upi_fraud`, `phishing`) |
| `extractedIntelligence` | `object` | All extracted intel — phones, accounts, UPIs, links, emails, keywords |
| `totalMessagesExchanged` | `int` | Total messages in the conversation |
| `engagementDurationSeconds` | `int` | Total engagement duration in seconds |

## 🧠 Persona & Prompt Strategy

The honeypot plays **Ramesh Kumar** — a 58-year-old retired Indian government employee who is:
- Slightly confused by technology
- Easily scared about his bank account
- Cooperative but slow to act
- Speaks Hindi/English/Hinglish (mirrors the scammer's language)

### Turn-Phase Strategy

The system prompt dynamically adapts based on the conversation phase:

| Phase | Turns | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial Engagement** | 1–2 | Appear confused, scared, cooperative. Ask clarifying questions. Let the scammer reveal their hand. |
| **Intelligence Gathering** | 3–5 | Act gullible. Probe for phone numbers, UPI IDs, bank accounts, links using natural excuses. |
| **Deep Extraction** | 6–8 | Push for missing intel items. Use excuses like slow internet, confusion about UPI, need for callback number. |
| **Final Extraction** | 9+ | Last chance. Be panicked and cooperative. Go directly for any remaining missing intel. |

The prompt builder (`prompt_builder.py`) tracks what intel has been collected vs. what's still missing, and instructs the LLM to focus on the gaps.

---

## 🕐 Smart Pacing

The smart pacing system in `agent.py` ensures realistic engagement timing for better scoring:

- **Turns 1–3:** Fast responses (no artificial delay)
- **Turns 4–8:** Calculated delays distributed evenly to reach 63+ seconds by turn 8
- **Turns 9+:** Fast responses (pacing goal already met)
- **Safety cap:** Never exceeds 24 seconds per turn (evaluator timeout is 30s)

## 🔍 Intelligence Extraction Details

### Regex Patterns (`extractor.py`)

| Category | Patterns |
|---|---|
| **Phone Numbers** | `+91-XXXXX-XXXXX`, `91-XXXXX-XXXXX`, `0XXXXXXXXXX`, `[6-9]XXXXXXXXX`, international formats |
| **Bank Accounts** | 9–18 digit numeric strings (excludes timestamps, OTPs) |
| **UPI IDs** | `localpart@handle` without TLD (e.g., `name@paytm`, `name@ybl`) |
| **Phishing Links** | `http/https` URLs, `www.` domains, `bit.ly`, `tinyurl.com` shorteners |
| **Emails** | Standard email format with TLD (e.g., `user@domain.com`) — distinguished from UPI by TLD presence |
| **Keywords** | 30+ suspicious keywords: urgent, verify, blocked, OTP, KYC, lottery, arrest, etc. |

### Email vs UPI Disambiguation

A critical distinction the system handles:
- `scammer@fakebank` → **UPI ID** (no TLD like `.com`)
- `security@fakebank.com` → **Email** (has `.com` TLD)

### Scam Type Classification

13 supported scam types, detected by keyword analysis and LLM classification:

`bank_fraud` · `upi_fraud` · `phishing` · `kyc_fraud` · `job_scam` · `lottery_scam` · `electricity_bill` · `tax_fraud` · `customs_parcel` · `tech_support` · `loan_fraud` · `insurance_fraud` · `investment_fraud`

| **Intelligence Extraction** | 40 | 10 pts per non-empty field: phones, accounts, UPIs, links, emails (max 40) |
| **Engagement Quality** | 20 | Duration > 0s (+5), duration > 60s (+5), messages > 0 (+5), messages >= 5 (+5) |
| **Response Structure** | 20 | Required fields present: status, scamDetected, extractedIntelligence, engagementMetrics, agentNotes |
| **Total** | **100** | Sum of all categories |

## 🛡️ Fault Tolerance

The system is designed to **never return a 500 error** to the evaluator:

- **LLM timeout (>25s):** Falls back to context-aware pre-written replies based on scammer's message keywords.
- **Intel Agent failure:** Falls back to keyword-based scam type detection + regex-only intel.
- **Reply Agent failure:** Uses turn-aware fallback replies that still sound in-character.
- **Callback failure:** Logged but doesn't affect the reply to the scammer.
- **Agent error:** Caught at route level with a graceful fallback reply.

---

## 🔒 Security

- All endpoints are protected with API key authentication via the `x-api-key` header.
- CORS is configured to allow all origins (for hackathon flexibility).
- No sensitive data is persisted to disk — sessions are in-memory only.
